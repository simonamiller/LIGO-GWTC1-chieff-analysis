# LIGO GWTC-1 chi-eff population analysis
This respository contains examples of the code used for the analyses performed in my undergraduate thesis at Smith college. I hierarchically measure the mean and variance of the effective-spin (chi-eff) distribution across binary black holes using LIGO's GWTC-1. 

This work also appears in my publication Miller et. al, The Low Effective Spin of Binary Black Holes and Implications for Individual Gravitational-Wave Events, published Jan 2020: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06051

The scripts, notebooks, and other files in this repository are as follows, with scripts to be updated in this order:
1. `<GWTC-1_event_samples>` -- Folder containing the posterior and prior samples for each of LIGO's ten binary black hole detections. These samples are of course publically available, and can be downloaded [here](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1800370/public).
