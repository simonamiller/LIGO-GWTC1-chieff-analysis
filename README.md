# LIGO GWTC-1 chi-eff population analysis
This respository contains examples of the code used for the analyses performed in my undergraduate thesis at Smith college. I hierarchically measure the mean and variance of the effective-spin (chi-eff) distribution across binary black holes using LIGO's GWTC-1. 

This work also appears in the publication Miller et. al, The Low Effective Spin of Binary Black Holes and Implications for Individual Gravitational-Wave Events, published Jan 2020: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06051
